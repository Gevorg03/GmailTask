# Gmail UI Design in Kotlin

This project aims to develop a visually appealing and responsive user interface design for the Gmail app in Kotlin. The goal is to create a design that closely mimics the look and feel of the Gmail app, while also implementing basic functionalities.

## Features

- Sign-in screen: Allow users to sign in to their Gmail accounts.
- Inbox screen: Display the list of received emails with relevant details.
- Compose screen: Enable users to compose and send new emails.
- Navigation: Implement a navigation drawer or bottom navigation bar for easy access to different screens.
- Responsive Design: Ensure the UI works seamlessly across various screen sizes.

## Design Guidelines

To create a design that reflects the Gmail brand and provides a user-friendly experience, consider the following guidelines:

- Use the Gmail color scheme: Utilize the appropriate colors associated with Gmail, such as red, white, and shades of gray.
- Typography: Apply suitable font styles and sizes to match the Gmail app's typography.
- Material Design: Follow the principles of Material Design to create a modern and intuitive UI.
- Layout: Design screens that are easy to navigate and understand, with logical placement of elements.
- Iconography: Utilize relevant icons to represent actions and features within the app.

## Implementation

The implementation of the Gmail UI design will involve using Jetpack Compose, the modern UI toolkit for building Android apps. Jetpack Compose provides a declarative way to build UIs, making it efficient and flexible.

To get started:

1. Set up a new Kotlin project in Android Studio.
2. Configure the project to use Jetpack Compose by following the official documentation.
3. Create the necessary screens (sign-in, inbox, compose, etc.) as composable functions.
4. Implement the required UI elements, such as text fields, buttons, lists, and navigation components.
5. Add logic and data handling to support basic functionalities (sign-in, sending emails, etc.).
6. Test the app on different screen sizes and ensure responsive behavior.
7. Upload the project to GitHub and share the repository link.
